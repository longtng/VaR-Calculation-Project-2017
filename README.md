# VaR-Calculation-Project-2017
The Project for Fundamentals of Quantitative Finance Course in 2017

Value Risk (VaR) is a statistical technique used to measure and quantify the level of financial risk in a company or investment portfolio for a specific time period. Banks (in particular commercial banks and investment banks) estimate VaR to determine the extent and the ratio of occurrence of potential losses in their portfolio. For companies, this technique can be applied to portfolios in order to measure the risk of the company in their investment strategies. In our project, we analyze the stocks of four technology companies in the United States, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and International Business Machines Corporation (IBM). The data are collected from daily close prices from December 12th, 2016 to December 12th, 2017.

Our research includes parts. At first, we build the portfolio by using the equal weighted method to check normality of the data. The second, we estimate the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Conditional VaR (CVaR) by using 3 approaches, including Historical method, the mean-variance method and the Monte Carlo simulation method. The third step, we use the Extreme Value Theory to estimate the VaR and CVaR. At the last step, we assume the portfolio follow a power-law distribution and run the data with Monte Carlo simulation.

We use R programming language to conduct for the analysis.
